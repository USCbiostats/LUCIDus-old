Title: Latent Unknown Clustering with Integrated Data
Version: 0.9.0
Author: Cheng Peng, Zhao Yang, David V. Conti
Maintainer: Cheng Peng <chengpen@usc.edu>
Description: This package is an implementation of the 'LUCID' method which is a tool to obtain a joint estimation of latent unknown clusters/subgroups with integrated data. An EM algorithm is used to obtain the latent cluster assignment and model parameter estimates. Feature selection is achieved by applying the regularization method.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.0)
